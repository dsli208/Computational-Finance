1) When you run the .py file in a editor like PyCharm, you will get a form asking for an input csv file.  Place your input file in a format like this: input.csv (input should be replaced by your filename)

2) Upon running the code, two plots should pop up.  One will be a PACF, the other one will be an ACF.  These should be clearly marked.

3) When the plots are closed, the program will complete, producing results for AR and MA fitting.  AR, then MA parameter values will be displayed, under "Params"
