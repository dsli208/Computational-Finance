This repo contains my projects from my Computational Finance seminar.  

`HW2` is a Binomial Tree program that enables the user to input a given set of parameters and calculate the price of a stock option based on the construction of a binomial tree.

`HW4` is a program for plotting ACF and PACF functions.
