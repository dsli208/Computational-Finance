Running the program:

1) If you are running this in the command-line (Ubuntu terminal, command prompt, e.g.), cd to the directory containing the files
2) Enter `python american_put.py` or `python asian_call.py` to start the program
3) Upon doing so, the program should prompt you to enter a file (the sample files provided are in .txt form).  Make sure you surround the filename with quotations (e.g. "sample.txt"), otherwise it will cause the program to output a stack trace and not the actual result.

(If you are running this in a IDE such as PyCharm, no need to perform steps 1 and 2, just run the program and enter the filename)
